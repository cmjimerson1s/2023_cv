            education with real-world expertise. Armed with a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development from 
            the University of West Scotland: Code Institute, I am eager and excited to take all my skills and knowledge
            from my previous professional opportunities and further evolve my software development toolset. My 
            leadership acumen is best demonstrated by my roles as General Manager at Fox in a Box Stockholm AB and Managing Director at Puzzle Escape Room AB, 
            where I orchestrated high-performing teams and steered record-breaking sales. Concurrently, 
            my technical education was mirrored in roles such as Client Support Technician at 
            Retail Data Systems and Deputy I.T. Help Desk Manager at U.S. Toy Co, managing intricate 
            IT systems from server configuration to e-commerce platform oversight. This symbiotic 
            relationship between my academic achievements and professional accomplishments positions
